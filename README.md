**Adaptive strategy infrastructure for living Theories of Change**

## Overview

**Decidodek** is an open-source change management platform that helps teams and organizations design, adapt, and reflect on complex Theories of Change. It combines traditional outcome-mapping methods with innovative facilitation tools to hold nuance, surface contradictions, and track alignment over time.

While many tools emphasize logic models and fixed plans, Decidodek is built for **fluidity, emergence, and adaptive learning**. It's particularly useful when strategies must evolve in response to shifting conditions, power dynamics, or stakeholder needs.

## Why Decidodek?

Most Theory of Change processes aim to map how change is expected to happen. But in complex systems, **change doesn't always follow a linear path** - and the assumptions beneath our models can drift.

Decidodek introduces a structured-yet-flexible environment to:

- Make assumptions and causal pathways explicit
- Track emotional and strategic alignment over time
- Support collective sense-making in periods of uncertainty
- Reflect on unintended consequences, tensions, and “drift”
- Revise ToC models collaboratively through facilitated sessions

## Core Features

- **Outcome Mapping + Drift Tracking**  
  Monitor how outcomes align (or misalign) with original intentions

- **Facilitation Tools & Card Decks**  
  Guide groups through strategy reflection, risk scanning, and adaptive scenario building

- **Theory-of-Change Modeling Layer**  
  Customize your own ToC diagrams, with space for contradictory or evolving logic

- **Collaborative Session Logs**  
  Embed reflections, notes, and alternative futures directly into your planning process

- **Tool and Process Registry**  
  Store, remix, and document frameworks used across your organization

## Who is Decidodek For?

- Strategy and program evaluation professionals working in complex systems  
- Funders and grantees seeking participatory evaluation methods  
- Social justice orgs rethinking traditional planning formats  
- Cross-disciplinary teams who want a shared, reflective space for change modeling

## Philosophy

Decidodek is not just a tool - it's a refusal to treat change as tidy or neutral. We believe strategy is emotional, contradiction is generative, and learning is never linear.

Instead of chasing clarity for its own sake, Decidodek holds space for complexity and desire. It helps teams map not only what they aim to do - but also what they're not willing to betray in the process.

This is strategy with care. With contradiction. With ghosts. [Read the full document →](/doc/PHILOSOPHY.md)
