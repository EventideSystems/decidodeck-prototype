## Decidodeck Design

### Overview

Traditional Theory of Change tools can be characterized as diagram-centric planning frameworks that prioritize clarity, linearity, and institutional legibility. 

Decidodeck offers an alternative, replacing linear diagrams with a system of small, interoperable tools and processes that capture emotional nuance, contradiction, and systemic complexity.

The platform is built around three core architectural elements: **Workspaces**, **People**, and the **Tool Library**. These components are deeply interconnected and continually shaped by a dynamic layer of user-generated glyphs, which serve as the expressive medium linking strategy, emotion, and collaboration.

The architecture of the platform is guided by a set of **General Design Principles**, ensuring that accessibility, privacy, and other essential constraints are consistently upheld.

### Workspaces

Workspaces are the heart of strategic activity within Decidodeck. Within each workspace, teams work together in real time to plan and test strategies using a set of "bricolaged" tools - simpler tools that link together to form broader, interconnected systems of meaning.

Workspaces hold the artifacts relevant to a strategy - documentation, objectives, milestones, glyph constellations, and decision records. Workspaces provide a living surface where each artifact informs and evolves with the team‚Äôs strategic journey.  

Workspaces are also a site for ritual, for marking transitions, tensions, and moments of strategic significance. Within each Workspace, artifacts and facilitated interactions form a living record of what was risked, refused, and remembered ‚Äî turning collaborative planning into a shared rite of passage.

### People

Decidodeck provides mechanisms for identifying the people and organizations that impact a strategy. The platform adopts conventions from traditional Customer Relationship and Stakeholder Management systems, but extends them to explore stakeholder connections, influence dynamics, potential conflicts, and opportunities for collaboration.

In Decidodeck‚Äôs terrain, people are not users or resources ‚Äî they're participants in a living system. They are assumed to bring their own emotional lineage, thresholds of refusal, and moments of emergence.

This shift invites a more ritualized approach to strategic engagement. Relationships are not flattened into metrics, but attuned through symbolic thresholds, glyph constellations, and shared ambiguity. Decidodeck becomes not just a mapping tool, but a space for co-resonance ‚Äî where influence is navigated not merely through logic, but through longing, grief, and emergent solidarity.

### Tool Library

The Tool Library provides a curated set of strategic components that collaborators can activate and interconnect to build their shared model. Operating on the principle of **"bricolage"** (smaller interconnected elements), the Library includes familiar tools like OKRs, Theory of Change, and Fishbone Diagrams - reframed as configurable modules that can link via shared goals, data points, or strategic purpose.

Collaborators create their shared strategy model by activating and connecting these tools into a larger symbolic whole, selecting the tools most appropriate to their strategic mood, terrain, and unfolding context.This process gives rise to a living strategy ‚Äî a constellation rather than a linear map. Instead of following a fixed sequence, collaborators build a model that adapts to their changing context, priorities, and relationships.

The Library also contains **"d√©tourned"** counterparts ‚Äî tools that subvert, haunt, or ritualize the originals from the bricolaged set. Each one flips the conventional logic of its ancestor and reimagines its strategic affordances. 

These symbolic counterparts to the standard tools aren't just thematic reversals - they invite participants to interact with strategy as ritual, mood, and contradiction. They take their inspiration from the principle of "d√©tournement" - the deliberate subversion of traditional models to expose their limitations or reframe them in more expansive and transformative ways.

### Glyphs

Each tool, artifact, document, or stakeholder record becomes a vessel for glyphic inscription - inviting symbolic markup that traces emotional lineage, strategic memory, and emergent meaning. Glyphs form a living strategic memory - tracing emotional lineage, ritual thresholds, and systemic tensions across the platform‚Äôs terrain.

Glyphs serve not only as symbolic markers but as connective tissue, linking decisions, roles, and tools into a non-linear map of collaborative change.

Conventional markup systems - like tags or subsystem identifiers - tend to operate within declarative boundaries. They sort, categorize, and locate, often privileging clarity and efficiency over ambiguity or affect. While the glyph system in Decidoeck can be used in this way, it is intended to evoke rather than define. Applying a glyph within Decidodeck introduces a kind of semantic and emotional "weight", less a system of classification than a trace of where grief, fear, and joy are embedded in a team‚Äôs strategic memory.

### General Design Principles

#### üß† Cognitive Accessibility
- Use clear, concise language and predictable layouts.
- Support memory and comprehension with visual cues, summaries, and progressive disclosure.
- Avoid overwhelming users with dense information or rapid interactions.

#### üåç Cultural & Linguistic Sensitivity
- Design for multilingual contexts and varying literacy levels.
- Avoid idioms or metaphors that may not translate across cultures.
- Consider symbolic systems (like glyphs) that transcend language barriers.

#### üß© Assistive Technology Compatibility
- Ensure compatibility with screen readers, voice navigation, and alternative input devices.
- Avoid custom UI components that break semantic structure or keyboard navigation.

#### üåÄ Emotional & Affective Design
- Honor emotional states like grief, refusal, or longing as valid entry points.
- Use symbolic affordances (e.g. glyphs, fog zones) to hold space for ambiguity and resonance.
- Avoid overly rational or utilitarian flows that flatten emotional nuance.

#### üì± Device & Context Responsiveness
- Design for varied screen sizes, input methods, and environmental conditions.
- Consider low-bandwidth or offline access constraints.
- Ensure legibility and usability in bright light, motion, or fatigue contexts.

#### üîê Privacy & Consent Design
- Make data collection transparent and ritualized (e.g. glyph-marked thresholds).
- Avoid dark patterns or manipulative UX.
- Offer meaningful opt-in/opt-out mechanisms.

#### üß≠ Strategic Memory & Traceability
- Enable traceable lineage of decisions, contradictions, and emotional imprints.
- Use glyphs or symbolic markers to encode strategic weight and memory.
- Avoid ephemeral or unanchored interactions that erase context.
