Traditional Theory of Change tools 

Traditional Theory of Change (ToC) tools can be characterized as diagram-centric planning frameworks that prioritize clarity, linearity, and institutional legibility. They’re often designed to meet the needs of funders, evaluators, and program managers—less so the emotional, relational, or emergent dimensions of change.

Traditional diagramming in Theory of Change tools leans toward architectural clarity:

Presents a fixed topology: outcomes, pathways, assumptions neatly arranged

Encourages coherence and alignment, often for institutional legibility

Favors visual hierarchy: root causes at the base, ultimate impacts at the top

Optimized for export: reports, PDFs, funding logic, compliance rhythms

But in doing so, it tends to suppress contradiction, emergence, and emotional resonance. The diagram often becomes an artifact of consensus rather than a space of inquiry.

### Bricolage Approach





You’re offering a **constellation of smaller, interoperable tools**—each one carrying its own logic, tone, and strategic depth:
- **OKRs**: Actionable intention-setting mechanisms
- **SWOTs**: Reflective scans of internal/external tensions
- **Logic Models**: Structured outcome flows
- **Detourned Variants**: Ghosted versions (SPOOKs, Grief Logic, Desire-Growth-Split models)

These tools **don’t converge into a single diagram**. Instead, they:
- Interact, mutate, contradict, and haunt each other
- Invite facilitators to **curate rituals**, not just map strategies
- Offer **entry points for different intelligences**—analytical, emotional, speculative
- Create a **living strategic terrain** where visibility is modulated, and clarity is negotiated
