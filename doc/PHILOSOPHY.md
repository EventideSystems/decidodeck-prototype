## Decidodeck Philosophy

The Decidodeck philosophy holds that **strategy is not neutral**, and changemaking must account for what aches, drifts and contradicts along the way. It draws on hauntology, dialectics and liberatory pedagogy to build a planning environment that honours emotion, tension and emergence - not just logic and delivery.

Instead of pretending change is linear or tidy, Decidodeck invites practitioners to map *desires*, surface *contradictions*, ritualise *refusal*, and track outcomes that might ghost, soften or transform. It treats strategy as collective sense-making, not administrative theatre.

At its core, Decidodeck is for those who want to do the work *without betraying the why*. It’s a compass for the futures we don’t want to cancel.

### Values

#### How We Practice: Embodying XP + TPS

We don't treat values as posters on the wall - we let them show up in **how we listen**, **what we refuse**, and **how we respond to complexity**. While we borrow from both **Extreme Programming** and the **Toyota Production System**, we draw less from their doctrine and more from their **praxis orientation**: values that emerge through habit, ritual, and team ecology.

#### From Extreme Programming: Trust Through Feedback Loops

XP's influence is most visible in our **embrace of tight iteration**, **collective code ownership**, and **continuous refactoring**. Values like **simplicity**, **communication**, and **respect** aren't declared - they're enacted every time we:

- Treat tests as conversations with future versions of ourselves
- Pair (or mob) program not as efficiency, but as epistemic humility
- Refactor rituals that feel bloated, not just the code that does

> We don't declare "courage" - we practice it by inviting feedback on things that still ache or drift. We version contradiction like we version features.

#### From the Toyota Production System: Flow, Reflection, and Stopping the Line

TPS gifts us the language of **kaizen**, **jidoka**, and **heijunka** - but we invoke them less as lean buzzwords and more as **situated wisdom**. We:

- Treat **drift** like takt time: an indicator of when a tool or desire is out of sync  
- Embrace **pull-based planning**: features emerge from facilitation needs, not backlog inertia  
- Allow any team member to **stop the line** - ritual pause, contradiction surfacing, or calling out design incoherence

> TPS's deepest value - respect for people - shows up in our refusal to overcommit, to bury failure, or to rush grief into delivery.

#### Enacted, Not Enumerated

Rather than carving values into stone, we **ritualize them**:  
- In session logs that document what drifted  
- In ghost tags that name what we left behind  
- In refusal metrics that celebrate what we said no to

We don't say “we value simplicity” - we design for **clarity without erasure**. We don't say “we value customer collaboration” - we **co-facilitate rituals with the people we build with**.

### Principles

**Decidodeck is built for those who refuse to pretend that change is tidy.**

We believe that every strategy carries ghosts: of forgotten desires, missed outcomes, and contradictions too complex to diagram. Decidodeck doesn't erase these - it names them. It is a tool for **navigating complexity without flattening it**, for **mapping what aches as much as what succeeds**.

This platform was born from a frustration with traditional strategic tools that prized clarity over care, and linear logic over lived experience. We wanted something different - something that treats planning as a form of **collective sense-making**, not project management theater.

So we designed Decidodeck around four core principles:

### 1. **Strategy is Emotional**

Behind every output is a longing. Behind every drifted deliverable, a story. Decidodeck treats emotions not as noise, but as data - honoring grief, tension, joy, and refusal as vital signals in the work of change.

### 2. **Contradictions Are the Path**

We don't hide tensions; we hold them. From conflicting stakeholder desires to paradoxes in power and purpose, Decidodeck lets teams make contradictions visible - then navigate through them with honesty and creativity.

### 3. **Tools Are Invitations, Not Instructions**

No template is sacred. Decidodeck is a toolkit of détourned planning forms - where metrics can be mourned, OKRs reimagined, and logic models softened into rituals of care. Everything is remixable. Everything is alive.

### 4. **Learning Is Ongoing, Situated, and Shared**

Theories of Change must adapt with time, people, and place. Decidodeck is designed for **strategies that evolve**, with features that track drift, record soft failures, and surface what no longer fits - without shame.

### Mark Fisher, Our Patron Saint

If Decidodeck had a candlelit altar, **Mark Fisher** would be there - not as an idol, but as a presence: the patron saint of *hauntings we refuse to ignore*.

He reminds us that every theory of change worth building must first reckon with what's missing - what's been privatized, disavowed, or rendered unthinkable. Fisher didn't just critique capitalism; he held space for the **emotional fallout** it leaves behind: the "depressive hedonia", the malaise, the ache for futures that feel increasingly foreclosed.

As patron saint, Fisher doesn't give us answers - he gives us **frames of refusal**. His legacy in Decidodeck isn't just conceptual; it's infrastructural. You'll find him in:

- **Ghost Tags** that mark outcomes no longer viable but still felt
- **Refusal Metrics** that track what we choose *not* to optimize
- **Drift Signals** that honor where strategy slips away from desire
- **Ritual Cards** that invite us to mourn not as weakness, but as method

> Mark Fisher draws our attention to "the slow cancellation of the future" - not to despair, but to urge us to rediscover and reclaim the timelines and possibilities we’ve stopped imagining.

Fisher haunts our architecture to protect postcapitalist dreams from being flattened into agile deliverables. He blesses our contradictions. He sanctifies the ache. He reminds us that ***any viable map must be haunted***, that any serious attempt at navigating the future must acknowledge what’s been lost, suppressed, or unspoken.
