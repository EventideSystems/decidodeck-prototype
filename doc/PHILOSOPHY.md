## Decidodeck Philosophy

The Decidodeck philosophy holds that **strategy is not neutral**, and changemaking must account for what aches, drifts and contradicts along the way. It draws on hauntology, dialectics and liberatory pedagogy to build a planning environment that honours emotion, tension and emergence — not just logic and delivery.

Instead of pretending change is linear or tidy, Decidodeck invites practitioners to map *desires*, surface *contradictions*, ritualise *refusal*, and track outcomes that might ghost, soften or transform. It treats strategy as collective sense-making, not administrative theatre.

At its core, Decidodeck is for those who want to do the work *without betraying the why*. It’s a compass for the futures we don’t want to cancel.

### Values

#### How We Practice: Embodying XP + TPS

We don't treat values as posters on the wall - we let them show up in **how we listen**, **what we refuse**, and **how we respond to complexity**. While we borrow from both **Extreme Programming** and the **Toyota Production System**, we draw less from their doctrine and more from their **praxis orientation**: values that emerge through habit, ritual, and team ecology.

#### From Extreme Programming: Trust Through Feedback Loops

XP's influence is most visible in our **embrace of tight iteration**, **collective code ownership**, and **continuous refactoring**. Values like **simplicity**, **communication**, and **respect** aren't declared - they're enacted every time we:

- Treat tests as conversations with future versions of ourselves
- Pair (or mob) program not as efficiency, but as epistemic humility
- Refactor rituals that feel bloated, not just the code that does

> We don't declare "courage" - we practice it by inviting feedback on things that still ache or drift. We version contradiction like we version features.

#### From the Toyota Production System: Flow, Reflection, and Stopping the Line

TPS gifts us the language of **kaizen**, **jidoka**, and **heijunka** - but we invoke them less as lean buzzwords and more as **situated wisdom**. We:

- Treat **drift** like takt time: an indicator of when a tool or desire is out of sync  
- Embrace **pull-based planning**: features emerge from facilitation needs, not backlog inertia  
- Allow any team member to **stop the line** - ritual pause, contradiction surfacing, or calling out design incoherence

> TPS's deepest value - respect for people - shows up in our refusal to overcommit, to bury failure, or to rush grief into delivery.

#### Enacted, Not Enumerated

Rather than carving values into stone, we **ritualize them**:  
- In session logs that document what drifted  
- In ghost tags that name what we left behind  
- In refusal metrics that celebrate what we said no to

We don't say “we value simplicity” - we design for **clarity without erasure**. We don't say “we value customer collaboration” - we **co-facilitate rituals with the people we build with**.

### Principles

**Decidodeck is built for those who refuse to pretend that change is tidy.**

We believe that every strategy carries ghosts: of forgotten desires, missed outcomes, and contradictions too complex to diagram. Decidodeck doesn't erase these - it names them. It is a tool for **navigating complexity without flattening it**, for **mapping what aches as much as what succeeds**.

This platform was born from a frustration with traditional strategic tools that prized clarity over care, and linear logic over lived experience. We wanted something different - something that treats planning as a form of **collective sense-making**, not project management theater.

So we designed Decidodeck around four core principles:

### 1. **Strategy is Emotional**

Behind every output is a longing. Behind every drifted deliverable, a story. Decidodeck treats emotions not as noise, but as data - honoring grief, tension, joy, and refusal as vital signals in the work of change.

### 2. **Contradictions Are the Path**

We don't hide tensions; we hold them. From conflicting stakeholder desires to paradoxes in power and purpose, Decidodeck lets teams make contradictions visible - then navigate through them with honesty and creativity.

### 3. **Tools Are Invitations, Not Instructions**

No template is sacred. Decidodeck is a toolkit of détourned planning forms - where metrics can be mourned, OKRs reimagined, and logic models softened into rituals of care. Everything is remixable. Everything is alive.

### 4. **Learning Is Ongoing, Situated, and Shared**

Theories of Change must adapt with time, people, and place. Decidodeck is designed for **strategies that evolve**, with features that track drift, record soft failures, and surface what no longer fits - without shame.

### Mark Fisher, Our Patron Saint

If Decidodeck had a candlelit altar, **Mark Fisher** would be there - not as an idol, but as a presence: the patron saint of *hauntings we refuse to ignore*.

He reminds us that every theory of change worth building must first reckon with what's missing - what's been privatized, disavowed, or rendered unthinkable. Fisher didn't just critique capitalism; he held space for the **emotional fallout** it leaves behind: the “depressive hedonia,” the malaise, the ache for futures that feel increasingly foreclosed.

As patron saint, Fisher doesn't give us answers - he gives us **frames of refusal**. His legacy in Decidodeck isn't just conceptual; it's infrastructural. You'll find him in:

- **Ghost Tags** that mark outcomes no longer viable but still felt
- **Refusal Metrics** that track what we choose *not* to optimize
- **Drift Signals** that honor where strategy slips away from desire
- **Ritual Cards** that invite us to mourn not as weakness, but as method

> “The slow cancellation of the future,” he wrote - not to despair, but to call us to **reopen temporalities** thought lost.

Fisher haunts our architecture to protect postcapitalist dreams from being flattened into agile deliverables. He blesses our contradictions. He sanctifies the ache. He reminds us that ***any viable map must be haunted***.
